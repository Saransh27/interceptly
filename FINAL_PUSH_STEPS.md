## 🔑 Now You Need a Personal Access Token

This is required because you're switching from ImSaranshMehra to Saransh27.

### Create Token (5 minutes):

1. **Login to GitHub as Saransh27**
   - https://github.com/Saransh27

2. **Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**
   - Or direct: https://github.com/settings/tokens

3. **Click "Generate new token (classic)"**

4. **Fill in:**
   - Name: `Interceptly`
   - Expiration: 90 days or longer
   - Scopes: Check **`repo`** ✓

5. **Click "Generate token"**

6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (long string starting with `ghp_`)
   - Save it somewhere safe temporarily

---

## 🚀 Push with Token

Once you have the token, run this command:

```bash
cd c:\Interceptly

# Set the user
git config user.name "Saransh27"
git config user.email "your.email@gmail.com"

# Try pushing (will ask for credentials)
git push -u origin main
```

**When asked for credentials:**
- **Username**: `Saransh27`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your password)

---

## OR Use Token in URL (Easier)

If you want to avoid being prompted:

```bash
cd c:\Interceptly

# Update remote with token
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin https://Saransh27:YOUR_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/Saransh27/interceptly.git

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token

# Push (no prompt)
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://Saransh27:ghp_abcd1234efgh5678ijklmnop@github.com/Saransh27/interceptly.git
```

---

## ✅ After Pushing Successfully

You should see:
```
Branch 'main' is set to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

Then visit: **https://github.com/Saransh27/interceptly**

All your Interceptly code should be there! 🎉
