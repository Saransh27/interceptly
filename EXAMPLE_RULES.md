## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Rule Priority
- **Lower numbers = Higher priority**
- Rules with priority 1 execute before priority 2
- Example: Set blocking rules to priority 1, redirects to priority 2

### URL Patterns
- `*://` = any protocol (http, https, etc)
- `*` in path = any characters
- Be specific to avoid unintended matches

### Testing
1. Open DevTools Network tab (F12)
2. Create your rule
3. Reload the page
4. Watch requests in Network tab

### Debugging Rules
1. Check extension background logs:
   - `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Interceptly ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Background
2. Look for rule IDs and patterns
3. Enable/disable rules to isolate issues
